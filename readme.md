## What?

A PowerShell module.
Note: this is my very first PowerShell module ever.

Written to automate some tasks which are repeated a lot in development and production environments.

**iTop API (REST/JSON) functions**
This also inherits the limitations present in the iTop API, although there are some work-arounds available too.
The most important limitation is that with each HTTP request, only one object can be created, modified or deleted.

* `Get-iTopObject`: get zero, one or more iTop objects (core/get)
* `New-iTopObject`: create 1 iTop object (core/create)
* `Remove-iTopObject`: delete iTop object(s) (core/delete)
* `Set-iTopObject`: update iTop object(s) (core/update)

**Miscellaneous**
* `Install-iTopUnattended`: performs an unattended (automatic) (re)installation of iTop.
* `Get-iTopClass`: gets overview of each class, including parent and module where it's defined or changed
* `Get-iTopCommand`: shows all iTop commands in this PS1 module.
* `Get-iTopEnvironment`: set settings of an iTop environment
* `Invoke-iTopRestMethod`: invokes POST request
* `New-iTopExtension`: creates new extension from template
* `Remove-iTopLanguage`: removes all unnecessary language files
* `Rename-iTopExtension`: renames an extension. Renames folder, renames default files, replaces extension name in those files...
* `Set-iTopConfigWritable`: makes or keeps (every 5 seconds) configuration file writable
* `Set-iTopEnvironment`: set settings of an iTop environment
* `Set-iTopExtensionReleaseInfo`: sets iTop extension release info (in "extensions" folder defined in the environment)
* `Start-iTopCron`: starts iTop cron jobs

## Installing

Hint: you can make sure this module is always loaded by default.  

- [ ] Enter `$env:PSModulePath` to see from which directories PowerShell tries to load modules.
- [ ] Unzip the `.psm1` and `.psd` files in this folder. 
- [ ] Open a new PowerShell console window.


## Configuration example

"production" is the name of the default **environment** and should always be included.
You can add more environments by adding an '**<environment-name>**.json' file in `%UserProfile%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\iTop\environments`

‚ö† To be future proof: only use alphabetical characters, numbers or underscores in the filenames.  
Some words are reserved words in PowerShell, so this module will not use "default.json" as a name anymore.

**API settings** are useful in all cases.
All other settings are primarily when you have iTop installed on the same machine as where you are running the PowerShell module on.

**Variables**: any key you define here, can be used as a variable (%name%) in the other parts of the configuration. Strings only for now.

```

}

```


## Basic examples

You can execute for example `Get-Help Get-iTopobject` to get a full list and explanation of each parameter.

Mind that the structure is based on [iTop's REST/JSON API](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/page?id=latest%3Aadvancedtopics%3Arest_json).   

Retrieving user requests of a certain person (with ID 1).
```
$tickets = Get-iTopObject -env "production" -key "SELECT UserRequest WHERE caller = 1"
```


Creating a new organization. This will give you access to the ID (key) created for this organization.
```
$ClientOrg = New-iTopObject -Environment "production" -Class "Organization" -Fields @{
	"name"="Demo Portal Org #1";
	"deliverymodel_id"=$DeliveryModel.key;
}

# Print ID of the newly created object
$ClientOrg.key

# Print fields
$ClientOrg.fields
```

Deleting an organization.
```
Remove-iTopObject -env "production" -key "SELECT Organization WHERE id = 1"
```


Updating an organization.
```
Set-iTopObject -env "production" -key "SELECT Organization WHERE id = 1" -Fields @{
	"name"="Demo 2"
}
```

Mind that by default, iTop will currently not allow you to update/delete multiple objects at once.  
There must be one HTTP request per update/delete. To facilitate this, a `-Batch:$true` parameter exists.

Updating an organization for multiple persons.
```
Set-iTopObject -env "production" -key "SELECT Person WHERE org_id = 999" -Batch:$true -Fields @{
	"org_id"=1000
}
```


## Upgrade notes

**To version 2022-06-07 and higher:**  

Filenames of configuration files (.json) should only consist of alphabetical characters, numbers and underscores.  

Some terms (such as the previous 'default.json') are forbidden in PowerShell.  
The new default file is now 'production.json'.


**To version 2021-07-08 and higher:**  
Adjust URL to contain ```login_mode``` parameter to URL in configurations.
Currently supported values are 'basic' and 'url'.


**To version 2020-11-09 and higher:**  

```$global:iTopEnvironments``` is no longer available.

Settings are now available through `Get-iTopEnvironment` and `Set-iTopEnvironment`

**To version 2020-04-02 and higher:**  
If you used the functions from previous versions of this module, it might be necessary to make some changes.  
First of all: multiple environments are now supported (for instance: development and production).  
There's now one .JSON file for each iTop environment.
The default environment is named "production.json".

Furthermore, ```Remove-iTopLanguages``` is now named Remove-iTopLanguage for consistency reasons.
